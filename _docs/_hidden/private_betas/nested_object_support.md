# Nested Object Support for Custom Event Properties

Nested Object Support allows you to send arrays of data as properties of custom events and purchases. This nested data can be used for templating personalized information in API-triggered messages through the use of Liquid and dot notation.

## Limitations
- Nested data can only be sent with __custom events and purchase events__. This is not yet supported with user attributes. 
- The array data cannot be used for segmentation or in any other way on the platform outside of Liquid templating and triggering.
- Available on events/purchases sent __via API only__, the Braze SDKs are not yet supported.
- Partners for our HTTP Currents connector (Mixpanel, Amplitude, mParticle, and Segment) do not yet support nested arrays data in event properties. Until this is supported, we recommend against using this feature with app groups that have HTTP Currents integrations enabled. 

## Usage Examples

### API Request Body

{% tabs %}
{% tab Music Example %}

Shown below is a `/users/track` example with a "Played Song" custom event. Once a song has been played, to capture the properties of the song, we will send an API request that lists "songs" as a property, and an array of the nested properties of the songs.

```
...
properties: {
  ...
  "songs" :[{
    "title" : "Smells Like Teen Spirit",
    "artist" : "Nirvana",
    "album" : {
      "name" : "Nevermind",
      "yearReleased" : "1991"
    }
  }],
  ...
}
...
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab Restaurant Example%}

Shown below is a `/users/track` example with an "Ordered" custom event. Once an order has been completed, to capture properties of that order, we will send an API request that lists "r_details" as a property, and the nested properties of that order.

```
...
properties:{
  ...
  "r_details" : {
    "name" : "McDonalds",
    "identifier" : "12345678",
    "location" ; {
      "city" : "Montclair",
      "state" : "NJ"
    }
  },
  ...
}
...
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Liquid Templating

The Liquid templating example below shows how to reference the nested properties saved from the above API request and use them in your API-triggered Liquid messaging. Using Liquid and dot notation, traverse the nested data array to find the specific node you would like to include in your API-triggered messages.

{% tabs local %}
{% tab Music Example %}
Templating in Liquid in a message triggered by the "Liked Song" event:

{% raw %}
`{{event_properties.${songs}[0].album[0].name}}` - "Nevermind"<br>
`{{event_properties.${songs}[0].title}}` - "Smells Like Teen Spirit"
{% endraw %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Campaign Triggering

Campaign triggering is supported for object custom event properties only. To use these properties to trigger a campaign, select your custom event, and add a __Nested Object Property__ filter. 

{% tabs %}
{% tab Music Example %}

Triggering a campaign with nested properties from the "Liked Song" event:

![Triggering Campaign]({% image_buster /assets/img/nested_object2.png %})

{% endtab %}
{% tab Restaurant Example %}

Triggering a campaign with nested properties from the "Ordered" event:

![Triggering Campaign]({% image_buster /assets/img/nested_object1.png %})

`r_details.name` - "Mcdonalds"<br>
`r_details.location.city` - "Montclair"
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Frequently Asked Questions

{% details Does this consume additional data points? %}

Array properties are treated the same as other event type properties, so there is no change in how we charge data points as a result of adding the capability

{% enddetails %}

{% details How much data can be sent in the array? %}

The maximum payload for all combined properties on an event is 50kb. Any request over that size limit will be rejected.
