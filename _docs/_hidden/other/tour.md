# Welcome!

Welcome to the new and improved Braze Docs! Along with our recent rebranding and refocus on your bonds with your customer or user, we have decided to rebrand and refocus our documentation on __you__, the Braze User.

Let's jump right in and take a look!

## All of Your Braze Docs in One Place

Welcome to our unified Docs site - your new knowledge base for all things related to the Braze platform.

![homepages][1]

Learn more about the new sections of our Docs site below.

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [User Guide][7] | Built for anyone who considers them-self a Braze User, this section is a thorough, public manual for the Braze product. |
| [Developer Guide][8]	| Meant for developers and engineers, this is a series of easy-to-use guides for implementing the Braze product and using the Braze REST API. |
| [Technology Partners][9]	| This section supplements the Partnership Hub that elaborates on the implementation of available partners (we call them Alloys!) with Braze.	|
| [Help][10] | This provides additional content not typically found in the guides that will up level and improve your experience and is for anyone and everyone! |
