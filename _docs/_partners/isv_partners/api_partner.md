# API Partner Integration

Alloys ISV partners are required to add their partner name to the `partner` field in their API Requests, allowing Braze to track API partner usage such as incoming requests from partners. Please reference the following [/users/track]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_track/) endpoint structure when developing your implementation.

## Partner Request Body

```

   "attributes" : (optional, array of Attributes Object),
   "events" : (optional, array of Event Object),
   "purchases" : (optional, array of Purchase Object),
   "partner" : (required, string)
}
