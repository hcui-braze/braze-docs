# In-App Messages

__In-App Messages__ help you get content to your user without interrupting their day with a push notification. Customized and tailored in-app messages enhance the user experience and help your audience get the most value out of your app. With a variety of layouts and customization tools to choose from, in-app messages engage your users more than ever before.

To see examples of in-app messages, check out our [Client Integration Gallery][83].

## When to Use In-App Messages

In-app messages are good for a lot of things. They can be used in web apps, Android apps, iOS apps, and more!

In-app messages don't deliver outside of the user's app and won't intrude on their home screen, like push notifications do. In-app messages, by their nature, exist within your app and come with context and are almost never unwelcome! They're always delivered when the user is active within your app.

### Great Use Cases

- App Management

## In-App Message Types

Braze offers several default in-app message types, each customizable with messages, images, [Font Awesome][15] icons, click actions, analytics, editable styling and color schemes.  The currently available types are `Slideup`, `Modal`, `Full`, and `HTML Full`.  It is also possible to [define your own custom in-app message view]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/fireos/in-app_messaging/customization/#custom-view).

All in-app messages implement the [`IInAppMessage`][3] interface, which defines basic behavior and traits for all in-app messages.  [`InAppMessageBase`][27] is an abstract class that implements `IInAppMessage` and provides the foundational in-app message implementation.  All in-app message classes are subclasses of `InAppMessageBase`.

In addition, there is a subinterface of `IInAppMessage` called [`IInAppMessageImmersive`][8], which adds click action and analytics enabled [buttons][50], as well as header text and a close button.  [`InAppMessageImmersiveBase`][28] is an abstract class that implements `IInAppMessageImmersive` and provides the foundational `immersive` in-app message implementation.  `Modal` and `Full` in-app messages are subclasses of `InAppMessageImmersiveBase`.

HTML Full in-app messages are [`InAppMessageHtmlFull`][51] instances, which implement [`IInAppMessageHtml`][52], another subclass of `IInAppMessage`.

### Expected Behaviors by Message Types

These are what each in-app message type will appear like for your users.

{% tabs %}
  {% tab Slideup %}
  [`Slideup`](https://appboy.github.io/appboy-android-sdk/javadocs/com/appboy/models/InAppMessageSlideup.html) in-app messages are so-named because they "slide up" or "slide down" from the top or bottom of the screen.  They cover a small portion of the screen and provide an effective and non-intrusive messaging capability.

  <br>

  ![Slideup Behavior]({% image_buster /assets/img/slideup-behavior.gif %}){: style="border:0px;"}

  <br>

{% endtab %}
{% tab Modal %}
[`Modal`](https://appboy.github.io/appboy-android-sdk/javadocs/com/appboy/models/InAppMessageModal.html) in-app messages appear in the center of the screen and are framed by a translucent panel. Useful for more critical messaging, they can be equipped with up to two click action and analytics enabled buttons.

  <br>

  ![Modal Behavior]({% image_buster /assets/img/modal-behavior.gif %}){: style="border:0px;"}

  <br>


{% endtab %}
{% tab Full Screen %}
[`Full`](https://appboy.github.io/appboy-android-sdk/javadocs/com/appboy/models/InAppMessageFull.html) in-app messages are useful for maximizing the content and impact of your user communication.  The upper half of a `full` in-app message contains an image and the lower half displays text as well as up to two click action and analytics enabled buttons.

![Full Example]({% image_buster /assets/img_archive/In-App_Full.png %})


{% endtab %}
{% tab Custom HTML %}
[`HTML Full`](https://appboy.github.io/appboy-android-sdk/javadocs/com/appboy/models/InAppMessageHtmlFull.html) in-app messages are useful for creating fully customized user content. User-defined HTML Full in-app message content is displayed in a {% if include.platform == "iOS" %}`WKWebView`{% elsif include.platform == "Android" %}`WebView`{% endif %} and may optionally contain other rich content, such as images and fonts, allowing for full control over message appearance and functionality.

<br>

![Full-Screen Behavior]({% image_buster /assets/img/full-screen-behavior.gif %}){: style="border:0px;"}

<br>

Full in-app message content is displayed in a `WKWebView` and may optionally contain other rich content, such as images and fonts, allowing for full control over message appearance and functionality.

{% alert important %}
Please note that we currently do not support display of custom HTML in-app messages in an iFrame on the iOS and Android platforms.
