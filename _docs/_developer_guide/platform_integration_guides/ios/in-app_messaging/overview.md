# In-App Messages

## When to Use In-App Messages

In-app messages are good for a lot of things. They can be used in web apps, Android apps, iOS apps, and more!

In-app messages don't deliver outside of the user's app and won't intrude on their home screen like push notifications do. In-app messages, by their nature, exist within your app and come with context and are almost never unwelcome! They're always delivered when the user is active within your app.

### Great Use Cases

- New App Features
- App Management
- Reviews
- App Upgrades/Updates
- Giveaways & Sweepstakes
- Sales and Promotions
- Product Sales
- Encouraging and rewarding discovery
- [Permission Requests/Push Priming][30]

To see examples of in-app messages, check out our [Client Integration Gallery][31].

## In-App Message Types
Braze currently offers the following default in-app message types: `Slideup`, `Modal`, `Full` and `HTML Full`. Each in-app message type is highly customizable across content, images, icons, click actions, analytics, display, and delivery.

All in-app messages are subclasses of the `ABKInAppMessage`, which defines basic behavior and traits for all in-app messages. The in-app message class structures as following:

{% alert important %}
By default, in-app messages are enabled after completing the standard SDK integration, including GIF support. 
<br><br>
__Note that integration of `SDWebImage` is required if you plan on using our Braze UI for displaying images__ within iOS In-App Messages, News Feed, or Content Cards.
{% endalert %}

### Expected Behaviors by Message Types

These are what it looks like for your users to open one of our out-of-the-box in-app message types.

{% tabs %}
  {% tab Slideup %}

  [`Slideup`](https://appboy.github.io/appboy-ios-sdk/docs/interface_a_b_k_in_app_message_slideup.html) in-app messages are so-named because they "slide up" or "slide down" from the top or bottom of the screen.  They cover a small portion of the screen and provide an effective and non-intrusive messaging capability.

  <br>

  ![Slideup Behavior]({% image_buster /assets/img/slideup-behavior.gif %}){: style="border:0px;"}

  <br>

{% endtab %}
{% tab Modal %}

[`Modal`](https://appboy.github.io/appboy-ios-sdk/docs/interface_a_b_k_in_app_message_modal.html) in-app messages appear in the center of the screen and are framed by a translucent panel. Useful for more critical messaging, they can be equipped with up to two click action and analytics enabled buttons.

 <br>

  ![Modal Behavior]({% image_buster /assets/img/modal-behavior.gif %}){: style="border:0px;"}

 <br>

{% endtab %}
{% tab Full Screen %}

[`Full`](https://appboy.github.io/appboy-ios-sdk/docs/interface_a_b_k_in_app_message_full.html) in-app messages are useful for maximizing the content and impact of your user communication.  The upper half of a `full` in-app message contains an image and the lower half displays text as well as up to two click action and analytics enabled buttons.

<br>

![Full-Screen Behavior]({% image_buster /assets/img/full-screen-behavior.gif %}){: style="border:0px;"}

<br>

{% endtab %}
{% tab Custom HTML %}

[`HTML Full`](https://appboy.github.io/appboy-ios-sdk/docs/interface_a_b_k_in_app_message_h_t_m_l_full.html) in-app messages are useful for creating fully customized user content. User-defined HTML Full in-app message content is displayed in a `WKWebView`and may optionally contain other rich content, such as images and fonts, allowing for full control over message appearance and functionality. <br><br>iOS in-app messages support a JavaScript `appboyBridge` interface to call methods on the Braze Web SDK from within your HTML, see <a href="https://www.braze.com/docs/help/best_practices/in-app_messages/previous_in-app_message_generations/">Best Practices</a> for more details.

The following example shows a paginated HTML Full in-app message:

![HTML5 Example]({% image_buster /assets/img_archive/ios-html-full-iam.gif %})

> Full in-app message content is displayed in a WKWebView and may optionally contain other rich content, such as images and fonts, allowing for full control over message appearance and functionality. **Please note that we currently do not support display of custom HTML in-app messages in an iFrame on the iOS and Android platforms.**

> **Starting in iOS SDK version 3.19.0, the following JavaScript methods are no-ops in HTML in-app messages: `alert`, `confirm`, `prompt`.**
