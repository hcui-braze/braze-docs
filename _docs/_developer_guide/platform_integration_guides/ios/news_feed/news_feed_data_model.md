# News Feed Data Model

## Getting the Data

To access the News Feed data model, subscribe to News Feed update events:

{% tabs %}
{% tab OBJECTIVE-C %}

```objc
// Subscribe to feed updates
// Note: you should remove the observer where appropriate
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self
                                         selector:@selector(feedUpdated:)
                                             name:ABKFeedUpdatedNotification
                                           object:nil];
```                                           

```objc
// Called when the feed is refreshed (via `requestFeedRefresh`)
- (void)feedUpdated:(NSNotification *)notification {
  BOOL updateIsSuccessful = [notification.userInfo[ABKFeedUpdatedIsSuccessfulKey] boolValue];
  // check for success
  // get the cards using [[Appboy sharedInstance].feedController getCardsInCategories:ABKCardCategoryAll];
}
```

{% endtab %}
{% tab swift %}

```swift
// Subscribe to feed updates
// Note: you should remove the observer where appropriate
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector:
  #selector(feedUpdated),
  name:NSNotification.Name.ABKFeedUpdated, object: nil)
```

```swift
// Called when the feed is refreshed (via `requestFeedRefresh`)
private func feedUpdated(_ notification: Notification) {
  if let updateSuccessful = notification.userInfo?[ABKFeedUpdatedIsSuccessfulKey] as? Bool {
    // check for success
    // get the cards using Appboy.sharedInstance()?.feedController.getCardsInCategories(.all);      
  }
}
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

If you want to change the card data after it's been sent by Braze, we recommend storing (deep copy) the card data locally, updating the data and displaying yourself. The cards are accessible via [ABKFeedController][44].

## Base Card Model

Braze has five unique card types that share a base model. Each type of card also has additional properties that are specific to each card which are listed below.

## Base Card Model Properties

- `idString` (read only) - The card's ID set by Braze
- `viewed` - This property reflects if the card is read or unread by the user
- `created` (read only) - The property is the unix timestamp of the card's creation time from Braze dashboard
- `updated` (read only) - The property is the unix timestamp of the card's latest update time from Braze dashboard
- `categories` - The list of categories assigned to the card, cards without a category will be assigned `ABKCardCategoryNoCategory`
- `extras` - An optional NSDictionary of NSString values.

### Categories

- `ABKCardCategoryNoCategory`
- `ABKCardCategoryNews`

## Card Methods:

- `logCardImpression` - Manually log an impression to Braze for a particular card.
- `logCardClicked` - Manually log a click to Braze for a particular card. The SDK will only log a card click when the card has the `url` property with a valid value. All subclasses of `ABKCard` have the `url` property.

## Log Feed Display

When displaying the News Feed in your own user interface, you can manually record News Feed impressions via `- (void)logFeedDisplayed;`. For example:

{% tabs %}
{% tab OBJECTIVE-C %}

```objc
[[Appboy sharedInstance] logFeedDisplayed];
```

{% endtab %}
{% tab swift %}

```swift
Appboy.sharedInstance()?.logFeedDisplayed()
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
