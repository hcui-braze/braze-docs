# Braze Data Retention Information

(Last revised in December 2020)

## 1. Data retention handled by Customer through Braze’s Dashboard or API

Braze enables its customers to delete certain data themselves from their group app: entire User Profiles and Attributes. 

Customers can: 
- Delete user profiles using the Braze User Delete API Endpoint: 
[https://www.braze.com/docs/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_delete/]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_delete/)
- Delete (null) or amend attributes on user profiles using the Braze User Track API Endpoint:
[https://www.braze.com/docs/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_track/]({{site.baseurl}}/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_track/)

Behavioral events cannot be deleted from a User Profile (custom events, sessions, campaigns, purchases). In order to remove those events, the entire User Profile must be deleted.

For privacy compliance, customers may need to delete all personal data pertaining to a User upon the User’s request. Customers can find instructions on our data protection technical assistance page at:
[https://www.braze.com/docs/help/dp-technical-assistance/#the-right-to-erasure]({{site.baseurl}}/help/dp-technical-assistance/#the-right-to-erasure) 

{% alert note %}
A User may have multiple profiles, and you may need to delete multiple profiles to delete all data pertaining to a single User. Follow instructions on the data protection technical assistance page on how to fully delete all data regarding a User.
{% endalert %}

## 2. Data retention handled by Braze

#### a) Braze database: automatic archiving/deletion of churned users - NOT CUSTOMIZABLE

Online documentation:
[https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/data_and_analytics/user_data_collection/user_archival/]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/user_data_collection/user_archival/)

Note: While archival of Inactive or Dormant User profiles is automated and the data retention is not customizable, customers can prevent archiving by running a data point on such profiles, thus keeping them active.

#### b) Braze servers: short time retention for recovery purposes - NOT CUSTOMIZABLE

Data sent from the Braze Services to the Data Lake via Braze servers is retained in such Braze servers for up to 90 days for recovery purposes.

#### c) Braze Data Lake data retention - NOT CUSTOMIZABLE

Data available to Customers within the Braze dashboard is mostly aggregated. Detailed logs are kept in a separate database created by Braze (the “Data Lake”, fka “BI Database”).

Braze has instituted processes to enable a custom retention policy scheduled to clear events at an app group or event level. This automatic deletion process applies to: Events, Purchases, Campaign Engagement Events (e.g., sends, opens, clicks), and Sessions data. Deletion of data in the Data Lake will not affect Customer’s segmentation.

#### d) Braze back-up servers - NOT CUSTOMIZABLE

When data is deleted from a Customer’s production instance, the data remains in Braze’s back-up servers for 6 months and is then deleted according to our internal processes.

## 3. Data retention handled by Braze for specific features of the Braze Services

#### Campaign Interactions Data 

<br>**What is it?** Campaign Interactions are data related to End Users’ interactions with a Campaign. They are used for retargeting filters and to determine Campaign re-eligibility.

**When is it deleted?** Braze automatically deletes from the Customer’s App Groups the Campaign Interactions for Campaigns that have not sent any messages in 25 calendar months. 

**What happens after deletion?**
 - Campaigns with no Campaign Interactions cannot be used in retargeting filters when setting up a new Campaign/Canvas/Segment.
 - Any active Campaign that already uses another Campaign for which all Campaign Interactions have been deleted in a filter will be stopped because the filter is no longer functional. Customer may re-launch the Campaign after adjusting the filters.
 - Any active Campaign that has not sent any messages in 25 months will be stopped because Campaign eligibility resets. Customer may re-launch the Campaign after reviewing the re-eligibility setting.

**How to reset the clock to avoid deletion?** To retain Campaign Interactions for a particular Campaign, customers can send a message using that Campaign at least once within the 25 months since the last message was sent.

Customers may request a shorter data retention than 25 months via their CSM.
