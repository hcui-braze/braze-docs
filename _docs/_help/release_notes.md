### iOS 14 Upgrade Guide 
In accordance with the changes announced in Apple’s new iOS 14, there are some Braze-related changes and action items required for Braze iOS SDK integrations. For more information, take a look at [this upgrade guide]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/ios_14/).

### Changes to IDFA and IDFV for iOS 14
In iOS 14, users must decide if they want to opt-in to ad tracking and let apps and ad networks read their IDFA when visiting an app. As a result, Braze’s strategy is to instead use the “identifier for vendors” (i.e. IDFA) so you can continue to track users across different devices. For more information, take a look at [this section in the iOS 14 upgrade guide]({{site.baseurl}}/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/ios_14/#idfa).

### Random Bucket User Event in Currents
The random bucket number (i.e. RBN) occurs every time a new user is created within their app group. During this event, each new user gets assigned a random bucket number that you can then use to create uniformly distributed segments of random users. Use this to group a range of random bucket number values and compare performance across your campaigns and campaign variants. To see if this event is available to you, take a look at the [customer behavior events glossary]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/event_glossary/customer_behavior_events/).

### Canvas Components - Coming Soon!
Braze has added four new Canvas components to help make increase the flexibility and functionality of your Canvases. These new components include: [Decision Split Step]({{site.baseurl}}/decision_split/), [Delay Step]({{site.baseurl}}/delay_step/), [Messaging Steps]({{site.baseurl}}/message_step/), and [Audience Sync to Facebook]({{site.baseurl}}/audience_sync_facebook/).
- __Canvas Decision Split, Delay, and Messaging Steps__<br>Decision splits can be used to create Canvas branches depending on whether a user matches a defined query. Delay steps allow you to add a stand-alone delay to your Canvas without the need for a corresponding message. Messaging steps allow you to add a standalone message where you want in your Canvas flow.
- __Audience Sync to Facebook__<br>Using the Braze Audience Sync to Facebook, brands can elect to add their own users’ data from their own Braze integration to Facebook Custom Audiences to deliver advertisements based upon behavioral triggers, segmentation, and more. Any criteria you’d normally use to trigger a message (Push, Email, SMS, Webhook, etc) in a Braze Canvas based upon your user data can now be used to trigger an ad to that user in Facebook via Custom Audiences.

### SMS Inbound Received Events
A new messaging engagement event has been added to Currents. This event occurs when one of your users sends an SMS to a phone number in one of your Braze SMS subscription groups. For more information, check out our [messaging and engagement events glossary]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/event_glossary/message_engagement_events/).

## June 2020

### Retention Reports 

Retention Reports now offer Range Retention - Range Retention measures how many users come back and perform a selected retention event during specific intervals of time. To read more about Range Retention and Retention Reports, visit out [Canvas][1] and [Campaign][2] docs. 

### Users/Track API Updates

The [users/track][3] endpoint now has a default rate of 50,000 API requests per minute for dashboard companies created after June 2nd, 2020. Existing companies created before this date and their app groups will still be allowed unlimited API requests to the users/track endpoint.

Braze is imposing this default on our most heavily used customer-facing endpoint as a step toward our stability and reliability goals for our API and infrastructure. The limit imposed is very liberal, and will affect very few dashboard companies and their regular operations. In the event that you need an increase to this limit, please reach out to your Customer Success Manager to request an increase.
