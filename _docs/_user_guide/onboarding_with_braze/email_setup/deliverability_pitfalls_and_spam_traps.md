|Recycled Traps | Email addresses that were once real users, but are now dormant. |

## Avoiding Spam Traps

These traps can be avoided if you set up a confirmed opt-in. By sending an initial opt-in email and asking customers to confirm that they want your messages, you're ensuring you send to real, valid addresses, and that this individual actually wants to hear from you.

Additional ways to avoid spam traps:

1. Send a double-opt-in email.
2. Implement a best-practice [sunset policy]({{site.baseurl}}/help/best_practices/email/sunset_policies).
3. __Never purchase email lists.__
