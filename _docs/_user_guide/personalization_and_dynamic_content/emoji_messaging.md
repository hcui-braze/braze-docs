# Emoji Messaging

If you are using Chrome as your browser, we recommend using the [EmojiOne extension] to conveniently insert emojis. If not, emojis can be sent to your users via push notifications or email in a few easy steps.

## Mac Users

### Accessing Emojis on Your Computer

First open the dictionary application and select 'Emoji & Symbols' from the 'Edit' tab at the top of your screen.

![Emoji Step One][1]

Next, browse through and select the emoji/emojis that you would like to use in your message.

![Emoji Step Two][2]

### Inserting Emojis Into Your Messages

To insert emojis into your message channels, select your desired symbol then copy and paste it directly into the body text of your message.

![Push Emoji][3]

## Windows Users

### Accessing Emojis on Your Computer

First follow [this link][9] to access the unicode native standards for emojis.

### Inserting Emojis Into Your Messages

To insert emojis into your message channels, **highlight**, click and drag the __native__ standard of your desired symbol into the body text of your message as demonstrated in the image below. You can also highlight the emoji then copy/paste it into the message composer.

## Troubleshooting

Many of the available emojis are currently unviewable in the Chrome browser. This issue will not affect the sending of emojis across Braze messaging channels, and the emojis will still be successfully delivered to your users. Try using another browser such as Safari or Firefox to accurately preview the emojis in your messages.
