# Messaging Users {#what-do-next}

{% alert note %}
Preview and Demo Predictions will not allow users to be targeted for messaging, and the __Create Segment__ and __Create Campaign__ buttons will be disabled. To purchase this functionality, contact your Account Manager.

## Implementing Filters {#filters}

Once you've decided what range of Purchase Likelihood Score or Category you want to target, you can use the __Create Segment__ or __Create Campaign__ buttons below the targeting sentences to create a new segment or campaign that filters for users with the Purchase Likelihood Score or Category selected with the slider.

You can also use filters in campaigns or segments to target the users according to that threshold. You can filter for users by Purchase Likelihood Score or Category in Campaigns, Canvas, and Segments, just like you use any other filter in Braze.

## Strategic Considerations {#strategy}

Now that you know who may or may not make a future purchase, start thinking about how you want to message customers and allocate your marketing resources. Here are a few ideas to jumpstart your Predictive Purchase strategy:

- Score a quick win by messaging users with the highest likelihood of purchasing. An email reminder about the items waiting in their carts, an in-app message prompt to “buy now!”, or a personalized push notification might just do the trick.
- Save the promotions for mid-likelihood users who need an extra nudge. Offer a special discount, retarget with relevant content on Facebook and Google, or share exclusive early access to a new experience (product, feature, or level).
- There are a couple paths you can test out for low-likelihood purchasers. Think you can convince them to make a purchase? Dish out higher discounts or do a concentrated cross-channel blast for three days. Offer personalized recommendations or hands-on support to make the purchasing process as simple and easy as possible.
- Or, drop these users into a more passive Campaign or Canvas as a resource-light way to keep your brand top-of-my mind. This could be a persona-specific weekly newsletter, a series of relevant customer case studies, or a monthly round-up of new tips & tricks.

Messaging users based on their Purchase Likelihood Score or Category doesn’t just help you make money - it helps you save money, too! Offer promotions on a sliding scale: the more likely a user is to make a purchase, the fewer discounts they likely need. Finding this balance helps you give and get the right amount of value for each customer. Keep in mind that you can also layer other filters onto these segments to further qualify who gets which messages.
