## Overview

![Churn Overview][1]

Predictive Purchase gives marketers a powerful tool for identifying and messaging users based on their likelihood to make a purchase. When you create a Purchase Prediction, Braze trains a machine learning model using __[gradient boosted decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting)__ to learn from previous purchase activity and predict future purchase activity. 

Once the Prediction is built, users are assigned a __[Purchase Likelihood Score]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/predictive_suite/predictive_purchases/prediction_analytics/#purchase_score)__ between 0 and 100 denoting how likely they are to make a purchase. The higher the score, the more likely a user is to make a purchase. Users can also be sorted by Low, Medium, and High Purchase Likelihood Category. 

__The real value of Predictive Purchase lies in the next step: using Prediction results to create a Segment or Campaign__. Marketers can build targeted Campaigns directly in the Prediction page for immediate revenue-boosting results, or save a Segment for a future Campaign or Canvas. Not sure who to target first? Read our (__[strategic considerations]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/predictive_suite/predictive_purchases/messaging_users/#strategy)__)  for messaging users based on their Purchase Likelihood.


## Access Predictive Purchases

The Predictions page is accessible from the left navigation bar on the Braze dashboard. For full access, contact your Account Manager. Prior to purchasing this feature, it is available in Preview mode. This will allow you to see a Demo purchase Prediction with synthetic data as well as create one purchase Prediction model at a time. This Prediction will be created based on your actual user data, but it will not allow you to target users for messaging according to purchase Risk. It will also not update regularly after creation.

With the Preview, you can also edit and rebuild this one Prediction or archive it and create others to test the expected [Prediction Quality]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/predictive_suite/predictive_purchases/prediction_analytics/#prediction_quality) of [different audiences]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/predictive_suite/predictive_purchases/creating_a_purchase_prediction/#audience).
